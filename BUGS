             Missing error checking for SPECGRID, DIMENS, COORD

2008-04-30   readGRDECL not working for Norne and Johansen.

2008-06-13   rock:
             Why is dimension of porosity and permeability vector equal to
             prod(G.cartDims) and not G.cells.num!?
	     FIXED

2008-06-24   mobility ratio in saturation solvers is inverted.

2008-06-24   number of permeability values == number of active cells?
             See entry for 2008-06-13...

2008-06-24   Gravity not used/implemented/... in assembleMimeticSystem.m

2008-06-24   Mobility adjustments for BIV and BIVW really needed [hmn asks]?

2008-07-02   rock == [] does not work.  Fix tests and examples!
             2008-08-14 -> ISEMPTY(rock) is not supposed to work!

2008-07-02   gravity runs without densities.  Wtf!?  Or...

2008-07-02   pside with index set (1:1) seem to crash.

2008-07-02   check S.constants gravity scaling

2008-07-02   bug in gravityColumn. facePressures are not correct. [OK]

2008-07-03   tests/mimetic_mixed_tpf:
             Smthng s wrng? Wrong R-O-N-G WRONG

2008-08-14   Possibly erroneous evaluation of well fluxes in
             multiscale code?  Currently uses divergence of cell flux.

2008-08-21   Boundary conditions are not supported in multiscale code due
             to design of coarse grid structure.  Needs fixing.  Urgently.

2008-09-18   Hack of functions schurComplement{,Symm} to restore Dirichlet
             conditions does not work.  Need to find a solution of some kind.
             FIXED?

2008-10-31   blackoilUpwBE.m does not implement flux \nabla\cdot(v f/B).
             B is missing!

2008-12-03   Implicit transport solvers fail when dt is very small.  
             Tolerance of residual should scale with time step, somehow.
