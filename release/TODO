NECESSARY IMPLEMENTATION:

* processing of eclipse files: 

  1. wells

  2. verify that grid processing gives normals neighbors(:,1) ->
  neighbors(:,2)


  3. update readEclipseFile.m


CLEAN UP:

* remove all "links" to black-oil, like z in the resSol structure. 

* look at default behaviour, should not do "things" (such as put
  default saturation) unless user specifically asks for it. 

* make comment in fluid object with example on how to plot relative
  perm. 

* code should follow coding standard

* check documentation in all files. Add examples in the documentation
  (like in the Matlab documentation. )

* add comments in difficult parts of the code. Abbreviate code in
  comments (write easier but slower/longer code in comments)

* remove use of single-precision.


MAKE EXAMPLES: 

* write simple examples
  - how to construct a grid
  - how to initialize perm field
  - how to construct the system 

* make an example that does simulation directly without (as far as
  possible) black-box functions 

* write detailed comments in all examples

* add teaser-examples


TESTING:

* test against gprs

* quarter five spot

* linear pressure drop


RELEASE: 

* talk to Trond about their server + password/email


NICE:

* compatibility with octave

* compatibility with older Matlab versions.
