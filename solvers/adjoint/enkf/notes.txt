Notes: 

1) to run the code you have to add to the matlab path this folder and subfolder and run the startup of mrst

2) the code is structured as


- my_enkf.m : starting file with assimilation loop

- setupSimulation.m : model parameters

- forwardSimulation.m : make a forecast for the next time


3)
The problem is in "forwardSimulation.m" lines 30-31, I tried to use line 26-27 but didn't work.
